GLASSONS NEW FOLDER FROM CLIPBOARD
================================================================================

DESCRIPTION:
Creates a new folder in Capture One using text from the clipboard. Replaces the
first space/tab with an underscore, adds to favourites, and resets the counter.

WORKFLOW:
1. Read folder name from clipboard
2. Process the name (replace first whitespace with underscore)
3. Create folder in Capture One's capture directory
4. Add folder to Capture One favourites
5. Set as active capture location
6. Reset capture counter

RECOMMENDED SHORTCUT: Command + 0
